   <p>A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material.

   Talasari Beach is a beach in the Baleswar district of Odisha, India. It lies on the north-eastern coast of India.
   The name Talasari is derived from the two words Tala (meaning Palm) and Sari/Sarani (meaning row). The palm trees surrounding the place gives such a name to it. 
   The word Tala also means rhythm, which is reflected in the sea waves lapping against the shore.
