   <h3>Golconda Fort</h3>
   <p>
   Golconda Fort (also known as Golla konda), 
   is a fortified citadel built by the Qutb Shahi dynasty, 
   located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. 
   Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, 
   especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds, 
   known as the Golconda Diamonds. 
   The region has produced some of the world's most famous diamonds, 
   including the colourless <b>Koh-i-Noor</b> (now owned by the United Kingdom), 
   the <b>Blue Hope </b>(United States), 
   the pink <b>Daria-i-Noor</b> (Iran), 
   the White <b>Regent</b> (France), 
   the<b> Dresden Green </b>(Germany), 
   and the colourless <b>Orlov </b>(Russia), 
   <b>Nizam and Jacob </b>(India), 
   as well as the now lost diamonds <b>Florentine Yellow</b>, 
   Akbar Shah and Great Mogul.
   The complex was put by UNESCO on its "Tentative list" to become a World Heritage Site in 2014, 
   with others in the region, 
   under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate 
   (despite there being a number of different sultanates).
