   Ladakh is a region administered by India as a union territory, 
   and constitutes a part of the larger Kashmir region, 
   which has been the subject of dispute between India, 
   Pakistan, and China since 1947.
   Ladakh is bordered by the Tibet Autonomous Region to the east, 
   the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh to the south, 
   both the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan to the west, 
   and the southwest corner of Xinjiang across the Karakoram Pass in the far north. 
   It extends from the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram range to the north to the main Great Himalayas to the south. 
   The eastern end, consisting of the uninhabited Aksai Chin plains, 
   is claimed by the Indian Government as part of Ladakh, 
   and has been under Chinese control since 1962.

   The word Harmandir means God’s House. 
   The man-made pool was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577. 
   In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib.
   The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal, 
   political parties and invading Afghan armies. 
   Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, 
   and overlaid the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830. 
   This has led to the name the Golden Temple. 
   The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism. 
   It became a centre of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883 and 1920s, 
   and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966. 
   In the early 1980s, 
   the Gurdwara became a centre of conflict between the Indian government and a radical movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. 
   In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star, 
   leading to deaths of over 1,000 soldiers and civilians, 
   as well as causing much damage to the Gurdwara and the destruction of Akal Takht. 
   The Gurdwara complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 damage.
